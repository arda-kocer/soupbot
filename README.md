# soupbot
soupbot is a Discord bot brought to you by suptower. It offers wide meme commands.

## Adding to your server
This bot is currently only available to exclusive servers. In order to add this bot to your own server, feel free to message me on Discord.

## Usage
There is currently no up to date documentation about any command for this bot. Prefix for commands is "sb", case-sensitive. You can always check this outdated [Documentation](https://bit.ly/soupbotDoc) in case you want information to older commands. I am working to implement a documentation on the own Wiki page of this repository.

I highly recommend adding the required "AUSOUP" role to your server if you want the bot to function properly. Simply create a new role called AUSOUP, you do not need to change any permissions.

Server Members with Administrator permission do IGNORE all command cooldowns. 

Command names are not case-sensitive (but if you pass the "info" argument to a command the argument must be lower-case).
